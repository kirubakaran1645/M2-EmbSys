# COMPLEX EMBEDDED SYSTEM
## BIOMETRIC ATTENDANCE  SYSTEM



### INTRODUCTION:



In this
project, we are going to design a Fingerprint Sensor Based Biometric Attendance
System using Micro controller. Simply we will be interfacing fingerprint sensor with Arduino,
LCD Display & RTC Module to design the
desired project. In this project, we used the fingerprint Module and Arduino to
take and keep attendance data and records.



## REQUIREMENTS:


### HIGHLEVEL REQUIREMENTS



1) The system should able to recognize the finger print
of the user



2) The system should verify the data of the user and
save them.



3) The system should able to navigate between different
function provided in the system.


### LOWLEVEL REQUIREMENTS



1) The finger print of the user is scanned by the
system using RC305 Finger print sensor module.



2) The data of the user can be stored in the flash
memory of the embedded system.



3) Navigation function can be enabled using the bush
button.

## COMPENENT USED:



1) Micro controller



2) Finger Print Sensor



3) RTC Module



4) LCD Display



5) Potentiometer



6) Bush button



## WORKING:



In this
Fingerprint Sensor Based Biometric Attendance System using Arduino, we used a
Fingerprint Sensor module to authenticate a true person or employee by taking
their finger input in the system. Here we are using 4 push buttons to register
new fingerprint or delete stored fingerprint or match stored fingerprint. The 4
push buttons are used as an input unit for these tasks. Similarly, RTC Module
DS3231 is used for registering scanning/entering/existing time of the user.



The LCD
displays the time record and every function happening via push button. Buzzer
indicates different functions and happening whenever an interrupt is detected.
The LED is used for power indication.



## APPLICATION:



1) This can be used in
educational institutions.



2) Biometric attendance
system can be used in industries.



3) Biometrics can be
used in ATM for authentication.



4) Finger print
authentication can be used in access control.



 



## LIMITATION:




 There is a
     chance of misusing the technology by placing a fake finger print.

 Modules are
     sensitive and they need to be handled carefully.



 



## CONCLUSION:



This project mainly comprised of development
of attendance management system and fingerprint identification system.
Attendance management is very helpful in saving valuable time of students and
teachers, paper and generating report at required time.
